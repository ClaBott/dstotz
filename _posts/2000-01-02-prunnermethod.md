“A newly revised and complete edition of this incredible scale and arpeggio system…the Prunner that I know, but new and on steroids!” – Catalin Rotaru, Associate Professor of Double Bass, Arizona State University in _Bass World_

“Bassists, if you buy nothing else this year, buy these…two magnificent volumes of scales and arpeggios for the 21st century…a must for anyone who is serious about developing a strong technique throughout the entire range of the double bass.” – David Heyes in _Stringendo_ for the Australian Strings Association (AUSTA)
