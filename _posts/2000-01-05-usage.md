##BIO

Internationally recognized teacher and double-bassist Daniel Stotz was born and raised in Oregon, and now lives in Phoenix. He studied with Gary Karr, Daniel Swaim and Catalin Rotaru, developing equal facility in orchestral and solo performance. Stotz earned his Doctorate of Musical Arts and master’s degrees from Arizona State University, and received an additional performance degree from the University of Oregon.

Since his debut performance with Karr at 17, Stotz has performed extensively with ensembles and festivals including Oregon Mozart Players, the Eugene Symphony, the Corvallis-OSU (Oregon State University) Symphony, Oregon Festival of American Music, The Phoenix Symphony, Yaquina Bay Symphony and the Bolshoi Ballet. He currently serves as principal double bass for Arizona’s West Valley Symphony and Arizona Broadway Theatre while actively teaching and acting as a clinician.

Stotz is also a composer, arranger and author of a revised, critically acclaimed edition of Joseph Prunner’s Progressive Studies for the Double Bass in two volumes, published by MMHC Music Publications. He presented his work on Prunner’s method and exercises at the International Society of Bassists (ISB) 2015 Convention.
